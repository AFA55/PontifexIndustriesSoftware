## WHAT WAS DONE (This Session)

### 1. Personalized Dashboards (Personal/Team Scope)
- `app/api/admin/dashboard-summary/route.ts` — upgraded with `?scope=personal|team` param
  - Personal: filters by `assigned_to`, `created_by`, `user_id` — shows MY metrics only
  - Team: shows full tenant-wide metrics (non-super_admin forced to personal server-side)
  - Returns `scope` and `viewed_user: { id, name, role }` in response
- `app/dashboard/admin/page.tsx` — rebuilt with scope toggle
  - super_admin / ops_manager default to team; others default to personal
  - Toggle visible only to senior roles
  - Personal identity banner: "Showing your personal metrics"
  - Scope-aware KPI labels and section titles

### 2. Job Progress Tracking & Completion Workflow (3-agent parallel)

**Database (migration: 20260331_job_progress_tracking.sql → applied to Supabase):**
- `job_scope_items` — admin-defined scope (work type, unit, target qty per job)
- `job_progress_entries` — operator daily logs (quantity completed per scope item per day)
- `job_completion_requests` — operator submits → salesperson/admin reviews → officially complete
- `job_orders` ALTER: `scheduled_end_date`, `actual_end_date`, `completion_submitted_at`
- RLS policies (JWT tenant isolation) + 6 indexes

**API Routes:**
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/jobs/[id]/scope` — admin CRUD on scope items + progress totals
- `GET/POST /api/jobs/[id]/progress` — operator logs daily quantities per scope item
- `POST /api/jobs/[id]/completion-request` — operator submits for review (fires notification to job creator)
- `GET/PUT /api/admin/jobs/[id]/completion-request` — admin approve/reject with operator notifications
- `GET /api/admin/jobs/[id]/summary` — full rollup: scope %, daily progress, completion status
- `GET /api/jobs/[id]/schedule-info` — returns scheduled_date, scheduled_end_date, status
- `PUT /api/admin/jobs/[id]/schedule` — admin updates scheduled_date/end_date with audit log

**UI Components:**
- `components/JobScopePanel.tsx` (568 lines)
  - Admin-editable scope items: add/edit/delete, per-item progress bars
  - Overall completion % bar, unit types: linear_ft, sq_ft, holes, hours, items
- `components/JobProgressChart.tsx` (182 lines)
  - Recharts bar chart: daily progress grouped by scope item / work type
- `app/dashboard/admin/jobs/[id]/page.tsx` (485 lines)
  - Tabs: Overview, Scope & Progress, Activity
  - JobScopePanel + JobProgressChart fully integrated
  - Completion request panel: approve/reject with review notes
  - Schedule date editor inline
  - Operator activity timeline

**Operator Workflow:**
- `work-performed/page.tsx` — scope items checklist with per-item quantity inputs; progress submitted fire-and-forget
- `day-complete/page.tsx` — fetches schedule-info; last-day detection hides "Done for Today"; completion modal with notes → POST completion-request → "Submitted for Review" state
- `my-jobs/JobTicketCard.tsx` — colored % dot next to status (green ≥75%, amber 25-74%, red <25%)

### 3. Bug Fixes
- `app/api/admin/timecards/route.ts` — fixed `.eq('approval_status', 'pending')` (was `is_approved=false`), ending 500 errors on sidebar badge polling

## KEY ARCHITECTURE

### Job Progress Flow
1. Admin opens `/dashboard/admin/jobs/[id]` → "Scope & Progress" tab
2. Admin adds scope items: "150 linear ft wall sawing", "cleanup - 4 hours"
3. Operator on `work-performed` page sees scope checklist → inputs qty completed
4. `my-jobs` cards show colored % dot next to job status
5. On last scheduled day, "Done for Today" hidden — only "Complete Job" shown
6. Operator submits completion request with notes
7. Admin/salesperson notified → reviews on admin job detail page
8. Approve → job status = completed; Reject → operator notified with reason

### Dashboard Scope
- `GET /api/admin/dashboard-summary?scope=personal|team`
- Personal: my assigned jobs, my created invoices, my timecard hours, my activity
- Team: all tenant-wide metrics
- Non-super_admin: always forced to personal (server-side enforcement)

### Database Tables (93+)
New: `job_scope_items`, `job_progress_entries`, `job_completion_requests`
New columns: `job_orders.scheduled_end_date`, `actual_end_date`, `completion_submitted_at`

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
1. **E2E workflow test**: schedule → dispatch → execute → complete → invoice
2. **Mobile responsive audit**: `/dashboard/my-jobs`, `/dashboard/timecard`, operator pages
3. **Patriot visual branding**: logo upload, custom colors in tenant_branding
4. **Production deployment**: Vercel env vars, custom domain, SSL
5. **Merge to main** and final release

## INFRASTRUCTURE

### Vercel
- **Plan**: Pro tier (unlimited deploys, cron jobs, edge functions)
- **Auto-deploy**: pushes to `feature/schedule-board-v2` trigger preview deploys; merges to `main` trigger production
- **Env vars required**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- **Cron jobs**: defined in `vercel.json` — daily health check at 06:00 UTC
- **Domain**: pontifexindustries.com → www.pontifexindustries.com (Vercel DNS managed)

### Supabase
- **Project ID**: `klatddoyncxidgqtcjnu`
- **Plan**: Pro (required for daily backups + PITR)
- **Automated backups**: daily, 7-day retention (Supabase managed)
- **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**: available on Pro — enable via Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → Backups
- **Manual backup**: Supabase Dashboard → Database → Backups → Download pg_dump
- **Connection pooling**: PgBouncer (built-in) — transaction mode for Vercel serverless
- **95+ tables**, all with RLS enabled, JWT metadata for tenant isolation

### Health Monitoring
- **Public health check**: `GET /api/health` — checks DB, auth, storage; returns latency + status
  - Response: `{ status: 'ok'|'degraded'|'down', checks, timestamp, version, environment }`
  - Returns HTTP 503 if any check is `down`
- **Cron health check**: `GET /api/cron/health-check` — runs daily at 06:00 UTC via Vercel Cron
  - Protected by `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` header
  - Writes snapshot to `system_health_log` table (DB size, table counts, check results)
  - Returns HTTP 500 if platform is down
- **Uptime monitoring**: point UptimeRobot / Better Uptime at `https://pontifexindustries.com/api/health`

### Error Monitoring
- **`app/global-error.tsx`**: root-level error boundary — catches crashes in root layout; shows purple/dark "Something went wrong" page with Try Again + Dashboard buttons
- **`app/error.tsx`**: route-level error boundary — catches page-segment errors; same purple/dark theme
- **Vercel Function Logs**: all errors logged via `console.error('[GlobalError]', error)` — visible in Vercel dashboard
- **Error IDs**: Next.js `error.digest` shown in UI for support reference
