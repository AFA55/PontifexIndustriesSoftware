# CLAUDE_HANDOFF.md — Pontifex Industries Platform
**Last updated:** Jun 4, 2026 | **Branch:** `main` | **HEAD:** `5dc04f77` — **Phase A + mobile + auth-UX + password-reset fix PUSHED → deploy `dpl_7spEQmZv…` READY/live** | **Production:** ✅ LIVE at pontifexindustries.com | **iOS:** ✅ **v1.0.1 (Build 6) APPROVED + live** · **v1.0.2 (Build 7) — "Waiting for Review."**

> 🧰 **New:** `DEV_TOOLING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` — ranked, popularity-verified plan to speed up dev & prevent recurring bugs (date lib + Sentry + Zod + TanStack Query + RHF + shadcn + tests). Phased, additive, no big-bang. Phase A (date lib + Sentry) is the highest-ROI next step.

---

## 📋 NEXT SESSION — Fine-Tuning & Productization phase (READ THESE FIRST)
We're shifting from feature-building to **fine-tuning + productizing**. The plan is split across detailed MD docs (created Jun 3) — execute in roughly this order:

1. **`PHASE_A_KICKOFF.md`** ⭐ — date lib + `lib/dates.ts` (kills the date-bug class), Sentry (prod error visibility), the global mobile CSS fixes, first Vitest test. Highest ROI, lowest risk. **Do first.**
2. **`MOBILE_RESPONSIVE_AUDIT.md`** — the "zoomed in" fix: global root cause (`-webkit-text-size-adjust` + 16px input floor + `pt-safe`/`pb-safe`) then per-page operator/admin fixes (worst: timecard table, day-complete signature scaling, `JobDetailView` max-w-6xl + dark mode, both NotificationBells). Global fixes overlap Phase A §A3.
3. **`SEO_HOMEPAGE_PLAN.md`** (+ `SEO_PLAN.md`) — rewrite homepage to the **custom-software + agentic-automations** positioning (still says "concrete cutting"); add robots/sitemap/OG/JSON-LD; server-render the homepage; build the Patriot case-study page; pricing→consultation redirect.
4. **`PRODUCTIZATION_PLAYBOOK.md`** — make the base **plug-and-play**: document feature modules (`FEATURE_CATALOG.md`), turn `tenants.features` into a per-tenant module switchboard, build a super-admin module toggle + `scripts/new-tenant.ts` onboarding. Patriot stays the proven base; new clients = config + branding + selected modules.
5. **`BACKUP_AND_CLOUD_STRATEGY.md`** — never lose data: tag releases + branch-protect `main` + monthly repo bundle; **🔴 confirm/upgrade Supabase plan for daily backups/PITR**; weekly `pg_dump` + storage-bucket sync to offsite cloud (S3/B2/Drive); do a restore drill.

**Founder action items surfaced:** Supabase backup plan (above); pick an offsite cloud target; later GBP/local-SEO setup.

> **💰 VERCEL BUDGET: ~$1 build credit remaining.** Every `git push origin main` = ~$1–2 billed build. BATCH and push ONCE per session. See `DEPLOYMENT_COST.md`.

## ⚡ START HERE (Jun 5, 2026) — Timecard: configurable late + no-show + holidays (+ settings-persistence bug fix) — ⚠️ build green, guardian PASS, ONE push pending

Parallel agents + architecture-guardian (the guardian caught a real blocking bug — see below). **`tsc` clean, build green, 846 tests pass, guardian VERDICT: PASS** (after the 1 fix). Not pushed yet. Plan: `TIMECARD_SETTINGS_PLAN.md`. Decisions: late = grace-minutes-after-scheduled-start; holiday pay = hourly field+shop roles, OT-exempt.

**Migrations applied to prod (additive, files in `supabase/migrations/20260605_*`):** `timecard_settings_v2.late_grace_minutes int default 15`; partial unique indexes `timecards_one_no_show_per_day` + `timecards_one_holiday_per_day`; new RLS table `company_holidays`.

**🔴 IMPORTANT infra finding — settings-persistence bug FIXED.** There are TWO settings tables: `timecard_settings` (legacy key/value, 20 rows) and **`timecard_settings_v2` (flat columns, the ACTIVE store clock-in/out read).** The dedicated settings page (`settings/timecard/page.tsx`) was saving flat fields to the key/value table → **writes silently failed → settings only lived in localStorage and never affected clock-in.** Fixed: `timecard-settings/route.ts` repointed to v2 with a page↔v2 column mapping (`require_nfc`→`require_nfc_clock_in`, `overtime_threshold`→`overtime_threshold_weekly`, `auto_clock_out`→`auto_clock_out_hours`, rest 1:1). Now the settings page actually persists. **Guardian-caught blocking bug:** clock-in selected `require_nfc` (nonexistent col) from v2 → 42703 → whole row null → late_grace never read; fixed by aliasing `require_nfc:require_nfc_clock_in` in the select (`clock-in/route.ts:117`).

**Feature 1 — configurable LATE threshold:** `late_grace_minutes` setting (default 15) on the timecard settings page ("Attendance & Punctuality" card). Clock-in flags late when `clockIn − scheduledStart ≥ grace` (scheduled start = `job_orders.shop_arrival_time`/`arrival_time`, same source as reminders). Writes existing `is_late`/`late_minutes`; management dashboard + punctuality tile already render them.

**Feature 2 — NO-SHOW button:** new `POST/DELETE /api/admin/timecards/no-show`. Writes a 0-hour timecard row (`entry_type='no_call_no_show'`, `hour_type='no_show'`) so it shows on the payroll grid + operator detail, AND idempotently upserts `operator_time_off` (no_show) so it converges with the schedule-board "Mark Out" (one row per operator/day, callout_count bumped once). Buttons: Team Payroll row action + day-cell chip (desktop + mobile card) + operator-detail empty-day quick action. Idempotent (pre-check + partial unique index).

**Feature 3 — HOLIDAY settings:** new `company_holidays` table + `/api/admin/company-holidays` (GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE) + `[id]/apply` (idempotent). New `settings/holidays` page (add/edit dates, per-day pay hours, applies_to all/field/shop, per-row "Apply"). "Apply" creates holiday-pay timecard rows (`entry_type='holiday'`, hours=pay_hours) for eligible roles only — **field=operator/apprentice, shop=shop_manager/shop_help, all=both** (role-based; `profiles.work_location` doesn't exist). **OT-exempt:** `lib/timecard-utils.calculateWeekSummary` now excludes holiday hours from the 40-hr OT base (+ a `holidayHours` bucket); holiday-only, behavior-preserving (0 holiday rows today). Settings-hub link added on `settings/page.tsx`.

**⚠️ NO App Store resubmission** — all server-side/web. Founder open items from the plan (`TIMECARD_SETTINGS_PLAN.md §5`): later consolidate the two settings tables onto v2 (the key/value one is now bypassed); optional holiday-apply cron; whether schedule-board Mark-Out should also create the timecard no-show row.

## ⚡ START HERE (Jun 4–5, 2026) — Smart clock reminders + productization scaffold + backup — ✅ DEPLOYED

Executive-engineer batch using parallel agents + an **architecture-guardian** review (the user's requested oversight agent). Backup taken first. **`npm run build` green, `tsc` clean, 846 Jest tests pass, guardian VERDICT: PASS (0 blocking).** Not pushed yet.

**Safety backup (founder's "make a duplicate"):** `~/Documents/Pontifex-Backups/pontifex-platform-2026-06-04.bundle` (288 MB, full history, `git bundle verify` OK, no secrets — `.env.local` is gitignored). Restore: `git clone <bundle> restored-repo`.

**SMART CLOCK-IN/OUT REMINDERS (deploys this batch).** Big finding: ~90% already existed (a `*/5` `clock-in-reminders` cron, `sendReminderOnce` dedup via `reminder_log`, tz window math in `lib/reminder-timing.ts`). We did NOT rebuild it — we closed 4 gaps. See `SMART_CLOCK_REMINDERS_PLAN.md`.
- **Start-time source:** the schedule FORM now writes `job_orders.arrival_time` (the cron already read it; the form previously buried the time in `scheduling_flexibility` JSON the cron couldn't see). New "Crew Start Time" `<input type=time>` in Step 5 of `schedule-form/page.tsx` → payload + edit PATCH → persisted in `schedule-form/route.ts`. `arrival_time` is **TEXT** (verified) — write "HH:MM", never `ALTER TYPE`.
- **Clock-IN cron smarter** (`app/api/cron/clock-in-reminders/route.ts`): added PTO/time-off skip (`operator_time_off`) + default-start-time fallback (`tenants.default_start_time`, new col, default `'07:00'`) so a job with no time still reminds. Existing pre/post (±5 min) windows for jobs WITH a time are unchanged → founder's "remind 5 min after start" works once a start time is set.
- **Clock-OUT cron NEW** (`app/api/cron/clock-out-reminders/route.ts`, `*/15` in `vercel.json`): 10h/12h/15h after clock-in. "Highest threshold crossed" + `reminder_log` dedup keyed `clock_out_<10h|12h|15h>:<clock-in date>` → never spams, survives a missed tick + midnight on night shifts. Reuses APNs/in-app via `sendReminderOnce`.
- **Migration** `supabase/migrations/20260604_clock_reminders.sql` (applied to prod via MCP): `tenants.default_start_time time default '07:00'` + partial index on `job_orders(tenant_id, scheduled_date) where arrival_time is not null`. Additive only.
- **Scope decisions (executive):** default 07:00 (tenant-configurable), helpers still get reminders, no quiet-hours v1, reuse `clock_in_reminder` pref toggle, **deferred** the night-shift form toggle (clock-out uses `timecards.is_night_shift` which already exists). 7 founder open-questions are in the plan §7.
- **Guardian nits (non-blocking, dormant):** clock-out shares the `clock_in_reminder` pref toggle; the PTO-skip's `.eq('tenant_id')` would miss a PTO row with NULL tenant_id (table is empty today); clock-out selects `timezone` but doesn't use it. None block.
- **⚠️ NO App Store resubmission needed** — this is server-side cron + existing APNs push; it ships via the WEB deploy and reaches the iOS app automatically.

**PRODUCTIZATION SCAFFOLD (additive, nothing activated — sell-to-other-companies foundation).** Chosen approach: feature-catalog + per-tenant switchboard, NO file moves. See `FEATURE_CATALOG.md` (24 modules mapped → files/tables/gating) + `PRODUCTIZATION_SWITCHBOARD_PLAN.md`.
- Key finding: 4 gating layers exist but only 2 are live (`user_feature_flags` nav gate + `lib/rbac.ts` cards). **`tenants.features` jsonb is stored/editable (`PATCH /api/admin/tenants/[id]` already allows it) but read by NO gate today** → the switchboard activates it with zero behavior change. A 2nd tenant (`APEX`) already exists.
- **`lib/features.ts`** (NEW, data-only, nothing gates on it yet): canonical 24-module registry + `ModuleKey` + `LEGACY_ALIASES` + a provided-but-unwired `isModuleEnabled()`. `defaultOn:true` everywhere + 5 `core` modules (jobs, notifications, team_management, subscription_billing, daily_reports) → Patriot keeps everything.
- **`scripts/new-tenant.ts`** (NEW, NOT wired to run): onboarding scaffold — inserts tenant + branding + first admin; hard guards refuse to touch PATRIOT (code/slug/id). Review before first use.
- **Next to ACTIVATE productization (separate session):** build the super-admin Module Switchboard UI that reads/writes `tenants.features` via the existing PATCH, then opt-in `requireModule()` on NEW non-core routes only. Default-ON rollout. See the plan's risk section.

**⚠️ Stale worktrees:** `.claude/worktrees/` still has ~95 locked trees inflating Jest (71 suites incl. dupes) — clean when convenient (don't nuke unmerged ones blindly).

## ⚡ START HERE (Jun 4, 2026) — Phase A foundation + mobile responsive + web Face ID/Remember-Me — ✅ DEPLOYED

Fine-tuning batch. Everything additive, behavior-preserving. **`npm run build` green (33.8s, 91 pages), `tsc --noEmit` exit 0, 12 date tests pass.** Verified the headline "zoomed in" fix in a live browser at 390px. **Not committed/pushed yet — awaiting the single Vercel push.**

**Phase A foundation (from `PHASE_A_KICKOFF.md`):**
- **`lib/dates.ts`** (NEW) — centralized date module that kills the recurring UTC/local off-by-one bug class (the "Zack: Jun 1 → Sun May 31" class). Exports `toLocalYMD`, `parseYMDLocal`, `formatDay`/`formatDayLong`/`dayName`/`dayNameShort`, `mondayOf`, `weekDatesFrom`, `weekDatesMonSun`, `formatTime`. `dayjs` (already installed) wired with utc+timezone plugins for future use. `lib/timecard-utils.ts` now **delegates** its date helpers to `lib/dates.ts` (single source of truth; all existing imports preserved).
- **`lib/dates.test.ts`** (NEW) — 12 Jest tests locking "2026-06-01 = Monday, shows 'Mon, Jun 1'" + Mon–Sun week ranges + previous-week offset. **NOTE: we use the EXISTING Jest setup (6 prior test files) — did NOT add Vitest (PHASE_A_KICKOFF.md was wrong that there were "zero tests").**
- **Sentry** — `@sentry/nextjs@^9` installed; `instrumentation.ts` (server/edge) + `instrumentation-client.ts` (client) + `withSentryConfig` wrapper in `next.config.js`. **FULLY GATED**: no DSN = complete no-op (zero behavior change); source-map upload gated on `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`. Build stays green with nothing set. **🔴 FOUNDER: set `SENTRY_DSN` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` (+ optional `SENTRY_ORG`/`SENTRY_PROJECT`/`SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`) in Vercel production to switch on prod error visibility.**

**Global mobile CSS (`app/globals.css`) — the actual fix for "looks zoomed in on smaller iPhone":**
- Added `-webkit-text-size-adjust:100%` to `html` (stops iOS auto text-inflation). **Verified live: computes to 100%.**
- iOS focus-zoom guard: base `input,textarea,select{font-size:16px}` PLUS a **mobile `@media (max-width:639px){ ... !important }`** floor. The `!important` is REQUIRED — a bare element selector loses to Tailwind `text-sm` (specificity), so the company-code input (first field everyone touches) was still 14px and still zoomed. **Verified live at 390px: now 16px on mobile, keeps `text-sm` (14px) on desktop ≥640px.**
- Added `.safe-area-pb` alias (was a dead class at daily-report:488 → zero home-indicator clearance).

**Per-page mobile fixes (4 parallel agents, disjoint files — real paths, audit doc had stale paths missing `admin/`):**
- **`app/dashboard/timecard/page.tsx`** — the 2nd wide `<table>` now `hidden sm:block` with a new `sm:hidden` card-per-entry block (no side-scroll at 390px); ~22 sub-14px text classes bumped to ≥`text-xs` (table body `text-sm`); Request-Correction button `min-h-[44px]`.
- **Operator safe-area** — `pt-safe`/`pt-safe-3` added to sticky headers on `job-schedule/[id]/day-complete`, `job-schedule/[id]/work-performed`, `my-jobs/[id]/jobsite`, `my-jobs/page`, `my-profile`, `daily-report`; bottom CTAs `pb-6`→`pb-safe`; `text-sm` textareas → `text-base sm:text-sm`.
- **`day-complete` signature canvas (functional, customer-facing)** — draw handlers now SCALE pointer coords to the 600×160 backing buffer (`scaleX=canvas.width/rect.width`, etc.) in both start + move; ink now tracks the finger 1:1 (was offset/compressed).
- **Admin dark/light + reflow** — `JobDetailView.tsx` got full `dark:` pairs (was white-only in dark) + `flex-col sm:flex-row` reflow + cut/hole tables wrapped in `overflow-x-auto`; **both** NotificationBells fixed (admin one was white-only in dark; `components/NotificationBell.tsx` was dark-only on the now-light shell → inverted to light-base + `dark:`); scope inputs `grid-cols-4`→`grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-4` + `text-base sm:text-lg` w/ suffix padding; `ScheduleDatePicker` width `w-[min(340px,calc(100vw-2rem))]` + dark pairs; `DashboardSidebar` drawer close button → 44px tap target.

**Auth UX — web Face ID + Remember Me (NO native build, App-Store-safe):** `app/login/page.tsx` already used react-hook-form with a real `<form>` + a remember checkbox. Hardened for **iOS Password AutoFill** (the key icon → Face ID → fills saved password): email now `autoComplete="username"` + `id`/`autoCapitalize=none`/`autoCorrect=off`/`inputMode=email`; password `id="password"` + `current-password`; "Remember me" defaults CHECKED, persisted to `localStorage['pontifex.rememberMe']`. **Supabase client config UNTOUCHED.** `company-login` needs no change. **A true native Face-ID launch-gate (Capacitor biometric plugin → new iOS build) was deliberately deferred** to a later App-Store-gated batch.

**Architecture-safety decisions made this session:** used existing Jest (not Vitest); dayjs was already installed; Sentry fully DSN-gated; agents ran in the MAIN repo (not worktrees) on disjoint files → no 81GB disk risk this session. **Pre-existing: 85 stale `locked` agent worktrees (377MB) with uncommitted changes from prior sessions remain — left untouched (don't nuke unmerged work); clean up when convenient via per-tree `git worktree unlock`+`remove` after verifying each is abandoned.**

**Password reset ("submitted email, got no reset email") — ROOT-CAUSED + FIXED (commit `<reset>`):**
- **Diagnosis (from 14 days of Vercel prod logs):** the forgot-password route NEVER reached the email-send step — `"Sending email to"` had 0 occurrences. It early-returned at the profile lookup. Root cause: `app/forgot-password/page.tsx` email input lacked `autoCapitalize="none"`, so mobile iOS auto-capitalized the first letter ("Zack@…"); the route's `.eq('email', email).single()` is **case-sensitive** (all 25 stored emails are lowercase) → no match → silent fake-success, no email. (`generateLink` also had no `redirectTo` → latent broken-link bug.)
- **Fixes:** `app/api/auth/forgot-password/route.ts` rewritten — normalize `email.trim().toLowerCase()`, match `.ilike()` + `.maybeSingle()` (no throw on 0 rows), add `redirectTo: ${APP_URL}/update-password` to `generateLink`, and **surface real failures to Sentry** (was silently swallowed — that's why this went unnoticed). Kept the generic enumeration-safe client message. `app/forgot-password/page.tsx` — added `autoCapitalize=none`/`autoCorrect=off`/`inputMode=email` to the email input.
- **VERIFIED end-to-end locally** against real Supabase: POST `"  Admin@Pontifex.com  "` → normalized → `✅ Reset link generated` → `✅ Email sent successfully via Resend! (Email ID …)`. **So Resend IS configured + working** — the prod failure was purely the email-normalization bug, NOT a missing key. Bogus email → enumeration-safe early return. `npm run build` green.
- **🔴 FOUNDER must verify (I can't from here):** (1) `RESEND_API_KEY` set in **Vercel prod** (confirmed working locally; prod env may differ); (2) Resend sending domain `pontifexindustries.com` **verified** (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) — else mail lands in spam/bounces; (3) **Supabase Auth → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs** includes `https://www.pontifexindustries.com/update-password` (or `https://www.pontifexindustries.com/**`) — otherwise Supabase ignores `redirectTo` and the reset link lands on the homepage with no session → "Invalid Reset Link." This is the next thing a user would hit after the email starts arriving.

**✅ DEPLOYED Jun 4** — commits `3bbf2704` (Phase A + mobile + auth-UX) + `5dc04f77` (password-reset fix) pushed to origin/main → Vercel `dpl_7spEQmZv…` **READY/live** (~116s build; longer than usual because Sentry's webpack plugin instruments the build). Live on prod + in the iOS app via webview.

## ⚡ START HERE (Jun 3, 2026) — 1.0.1 LIVE, web batch deployed, 1.0.2 submitted, disk fixed, timecard date bug

**iOS:**
- **v1.0.1 (Build 6) was APPROVED and auto-released** — the new dark purple-P icon + splash are **LIVE on the App Store** (verified via `itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=6772996692` → version 1.0.1, and the live 512px artwork is the purple-P).
- **v1.0.2 (Build 7) SUBMITTED for review** — its only purpose was to swap the **leaky App Store screenshots** (old ones showed real customer "Harper General CONTRACTORS") for 3 clean demo-tenant shots (login · schedule board · dashboard). Flow: bumped `MARKETING_VERSION 1.0.1→1.0.2` + `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION 6→7`, archived/exported, delivered Build 7 via Transporter, created 1.0.2 in ASC, **deleted leaky shots in Media Manager → uploaded the 3 clean 1320×2868 (6.9″ master; all other sizes inherit)**, filled What's New, attached Build 7, **Submitted**. Status: **1.0.2 Waiting for Review**.
  - **Screenshot gotcha:** the 3 shots are **1320×2868 = 6.9″ size**. They MUST go in the **iPhone 6.9″ Display** slot (Media Manager); the 6.5″ slot rejects them ("dimensions wrong" → 1242×2688/1284×2778). Once 6.9″ is set, 6.5″/6.3″ inherit automatically. **ASC `file_upload` MCP tool only accepts session-attached files** — had to drive the **native file picker** (Choose File → `osascript` Cmd+Shift+G + paste folder path + Cmd+A select-all + Open), with Chrome activated so the panel is frontmost. Clean shots live in `/tmp/appstore-0{1,2,3}-*.png`.

**Web (deployed `fecd216d` → Vercel READY, live on prod + in the app via webview — no App Store action needed):**
- **Animated launch intro** — new `components/SplashIntro.tsx` faithfully ports `splash-demo-v4.html` (self-drawing bridge-P, purple→red gradient, data pulse, wordmark), plays once per launch (sessionStorage) on `#1e1b4b`, then fades into `/company-login`. **Removed `autoFocus`** on the company-code input → no more keyboard auto-pop on launch.
- **Mobile responsiveness** — timecards/payroll page: phone view now a **card-per-operator** (7-day row fits, no horizontal scroll) + fixed light-grey dark-mode header → `#120a24`; visit-report step 1 fields fit; schedule-form Customer step (search + New Customer stack, Save & Exit not clipped, long names truncate); CalendarPicker date truncates.

**Operator timecard DATE BUG fixed (this session — ⚠️ UNCOMMITTED, needs commit+push):**
- **Symptom (reported by operator Zack):** clocked in Jun 1/2/3 but the card showed entries as the **31st = Sunday** with weekdays mismatched.
- **Root cause:** date-only strings (`'YYYY-MM-DD'`) parsed as **UTC** then rendered/compared in **local** time. In US (UTC-4/-5), `new Date('2026-06-01')` = May 31 evening local → "Sun, May 31". Plus `weekDays` mixed `toISOString()` (UTC) for entry-matching with `getDate()` (local) for display → entries shifted a day.
- **Fix:** `app/dashboard/timecard/page.tsx` — added `toLocalDateStr(d)` (local Y-M-D), used it everywhere instead of `toISOString().split('T')[0]` (lines for the week-range query, today, weekDays `dateStr`, isToday, PDF mondayStr); `formatDate` now appends `'T00:00:00'` for bare dates so they parse local. `lib/timecard-utils.ts` — `getWeekDates` + `getMondayOfWeek` now emit LOCAL Y-M-D (were UTC). tsc green. **Single-tenant US: device-local == tenant TZ, so this fully resolves it.** (Future multi-TZ robustness: thread the tenant timezone to the client — not needed yet.)
- **DONE:** committed `cefd3e85`, pushed, Vercel deploy `dpl_6LibXxqV…` **READY** → **live on prod + in the app** (webview). Zack's dates now line up.

## ⚡ START HERE (Jun 1, 2026 — PART 2) — iOS v1.0.1 (Build 6) SUBMITTED ✅

Apple approved the app, then Claude shipped the new-brand Build 6 **end-to-end via Mac + browser automation**: archived → exported signed IPA → delivered via Transporter → created the 1.0.1 version in App Store Connect → attached Build 6 → filled "What's New" → **Submitted for Review**. ASC status: **1.0.1 Waiting for Review**. Email will arrive when review completes (≤48h).

**Key gotcha solved:** first delivery as **1.0.0** failed with `409 Invalid Pre-Release Train — '1.0.0' is closed` (1.0.0 was already Ready for Sale, so Apple locks new builds to it). Fix = bump `MARKETING_VERSION 1.0.0 → 1.0.1` (`43ccb13c`), re-archive, deliver as 1.0.1. **Any future App Store change needs a new version number.**

**What shipped in Build 6 (v1.0.1):**
- **App icon** → dark `#120A24` tile + brightened purple→pink→rose **P**. Opaque (`hasAlpha: false`). Verified by extracting from the signed archive AND in ASC "Included Assets → App Icon".
- **Splash** → white P on `#1e1b4b`. **Launch white-flash killed** (LaunchScreen + webview + splash all `#1e1b4b`).
- **Smooth fade** → `launchShowDuration: 1200` + `launchFadeOutDuration: 600` (`launchAutoHide` stays true → no hang).
- "What's New" text: *"Refreshed app icon and a smoother, polished launch experience. Plus minor performance improvements and bug fixes."*

**How it was automated (for next time):**
- Archive/export: `xcodebuild ... archive` + `-exportArchive` with `/tmp/ExportOptions.plist` (method `app-store-connect`, manual signing, profile "Pontifex App Store Distribution"). Render assets: `assets/logo-concepts/render-native-assets.mjs`.
- Upload: **Transporter.app** (already signed in as andresafa55@icloud.com). Drove it via `osascript` (menu/AX) + **`cliclick`** for coordinate clicks (System Events `click at` is blocked by assistive-access; cliclick works). Transporter's list thumbnail shows a **cached old icon** — ignore it; the binary is correct.
- ASC submission: **Claude-in-Chrome** on the user's logged-in session (Claude can't enter the Apple ID password — user logs in, then Claude drives the rest).

**🟡 Pending:** wait for Apple review result (email). If approved, release. Local commits `11ccb96a` + `43ccb13c` are native-only and **not pushed** (no Vercel cost); push them next time web changes also go to main.

## ⚡ START HERE (Jun 1, 2026 session) — Brand "P" logo + helper architecture + Team Profiles → DEPLOYED to prod

Shipped a large UX/brand batch in **one push** (`3ede8fab..2755d488`, deploy `dpl_3bMcXajd…` → **READY**, ~68s build). All verified (tsc green per commit) and live on pontifexindustries.com.

**New brand identity — purple→red "P" (bridge-builder):**
- Final mark = single-stroke **bridge-P** (tower → arch span → landing), **purple→red journey gradient** `#7C3AED → #DB2777 → #EF4444`. Applied to `public/logo.svg`, `favicon.svg`, all PWA/touch PNGs (regenerated via `assets/logo-concepts/render-icons.mjs`), and `app/company-login` (white variant).
- Launch-animation spec lives in **`assets/logo-concepts/splash-demo-v4.html`** (final): aurora bg + self-drawing bridge + data-pulse across the span + circuit nodes + blueprint grid = "tech building the bridge." Watch via a static server in that folder. Plan doc: `SPLASH_AND_LOGO_REVAMP.md`.
- **Native iOS icon + splash are NOT changed** (still the old bridge) — those are native assets gated on App Store approval → ship as **Build 6** (`npx @capacitor/assets generate` from `assets/logo.png` + `splash.png`, then `npx cap sync ios`).

**Login / demo:**
- Demo-account dropdown now leads with **Admin** (`admin@pontifex.com`) + **Supervisor "David"** (`supervisor@pontifex.com`) — both `PontifexDemo2026!`. Header is password-agnostic; `DEMO_COLORS` map added. Reset David's auth password (handoff doc had it wrong) + renamed profile full_name → "David".

**Admin:**
- **Team Profiles** now visible to admin: enabled `can_manage_team = true` for admin role in `user_feature_flags` (PATRIOT). Link already existed in `DashboardSidebar` (flag-gated). New admins get it via the invite flow.

**Supervisor visit report (`app/dashboard/admin/site-visits/new`):**
- Date field now uses the shared **`CalendarPicker`** (matches Schedule Form); removed Arrival/Departure time.
- Equipment issues now unify into the **Maintenance Inbox**: `maintenance_requests` gained `request_type` (`repair`/`replace`, migration `20260531_maintenance_request_type` — applied to prod). Supervisor hook converts BOTH maintenance AND replace; operator route tags `repair`; inbox shows a "Replace" badge. So operator + supervisor issues all land in one shop-manager inbox.

**Helper (apprentice) architecture:**
- Read-only on the OPERATOR's ticket: `jobsite` + `work-performed` pages redirect helpers back to the ticket (can't proceed / advance status). Address still gated until the operator confirms equipment (helper-specific locked message added).
- Helper keeps their OWN simple **work log** (`HelperWorkLog`): "what did you help with today?" — type OR **mic dictate** (shared `useVoiceInput` hook). Clock-out still requires it. NOT the operator's work-performed ticket.
- Management sees it: new `GET /api/admin/jobs/[id]/helper-logs` + a **"Helper Work Log" panel** in the admin job detail (active AND completed jobs), beside Operator Notes.

**Operator dashboard:** "Daily Report" card + quick-action → disabled **"Reports — Coming soon"** (route kept; entry points removed). Field/Shop clock-in confirmed saving correctly (`is_shop_hours` + `work_location`; re-clock-in as Shop works). Equipment-issue card already → `/dashboard/maintenance/new` → Maintenance Inbox.

**Other:** `GoogleMapsProvider` honors `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_GOOGLE_MAPS` (kills LAN dev console spam); timecard lunch de-dupe/modernize; schedule-board toolbar labels; admin back-office dashboard.

**Apple review safety:** this was a **web-only** deploy — the in-review native binary, app icon, splash, and App Store screenshots/metadata are all untouched. (The iOS app loads `server.url` = prod, so the reviewer would only see the new login logo — harmless.)

**Pending / next:**
- 🔴 **Verify App Store review status** — couldn't read it (App Store Connect browser session expired). If approved → do **Build 6** (new "P" native icon + splash + the launch-animation/fade from `SPLASH_AND_LOGO_REVAMP.md`).
- The brand concept/animation files in `assets/logo-concepts/` are design source (committed) — not served in prod.
- Schedule-board still ~2,850 lines — extraction still on backlog.

## ⚡ START HERE (May 30, 2026 session) — Scaling analysis + rollout-hardening (10 agents, 3 rounds)

Patriot is about to onboard ~25 users. This session did a capacity analysis and a 3-round
parallel-agent hardening pass. **All pushed to prod in one build (`ef4b618b..c1735cdc`).**

**Scaling:** [`SCALING.md`](SCALING.md) — 25 users is trivial (DB 30 MB, 13/60 conns, all hot
tables tenant-indexed). **The one action that matters: upgrade Supabase Free → Pro ($25/mo)** for
automated backups of payroll data (Free has none), no auto-pause, dedicated compute, and it unlocks
leaked-password protection. **← user action, highest priority before rollout.**

**Hardening shipped (10 subagents, each verified — disjoint file sets, build green, diffs reviewed):**
- **Push notifications now fire across the ENTIRE notification surface** (11 API routes +
  `notify-salesperson`): job dispatch, completion approve/reject, change-requests, time-off,
  maintenance, callouts. Every call is ADDITIVE + fire-and-forget (`.catch(() => {})`) — a push
  failure can never break an API response. Also removed an undeclared `jsonwebtoken` dep risk in
  `lib/send-push.ts` (now delegates to `lib/apns.ts`) and hardened `/api/push` (userId targeting,
  self-vs-admin authz, tenant isolation, 503 on unconfigured).
- **Load-error + retry UI** on ~13 daily-traffic pages (operator: notifications, daily-report,
  in-route, jobsite, job-survey, settings/notifications; admin: timecards, completed-jobs, billing,
  time-off, team-management, team-profiles, schedule-form-history). Pattern ref: `active-jobs/page.tsx`.
  ~6 pages correctly left alone (no blocking fetch / already had it).
- **Mobile (375/414px):** maintenance/new, admin/maintenance, inventory-control, + `NewInventoryModal`
  — 44px tap targets, iOS focus-zoom fix (`text-base sm:text-sm`), overflow, safe-area padding.
- **Migrations applied to prod:** `20260427_utility_waiver_fields` + `20260427_operator_badges`.
  Caught + fixed a cross-tenant RLS leak in operator_badges before applying (was "any admin manages
  all badges" → tenant-scoped + WITH CHECK + updated_at trigger). Verified live.

**Pending / next:**
- 🔴 **Supabase Free → Pro upgrade** (user action — backups on payroll data).
- Push wiring is code-complete but **only delivers once devices register tokens** — confirm the
  iOS app registers APNs tokens into `push_tokens` (TestFlight/Build 5) before relying on push.
- Optional round 4: remaining ~45 low-traffic admin/settings/debug pages (diminishing returns).
- Schedule-board still 2,850 lines — extraction still on backlog.

## ⚡ START HERE (May 29, 2026 session) — App Store approval hardening DONE in code

**👉 The authoritative resubmission plan is [`APP_STORE_RESUBMISSION.md`](APP_STORE_RESUBMISSION.md)** — runbook + ready-to-paste App Review notes (demo creds: Company Code `PATRIOT` / `zack@demopontifex.com` / `Patriot2026!`).

A 4-agent Apple-guideline audit found the real (human-review) rejection risks beyond the location string, and they are now **fixed in code and live in prod**:
- **3.1.1 IAP** — all Stripe purchasing hidden in the native shell via `lib/is-native.ts` (`isNativeApp()`); web billing untouched. Killed the `SubscriptionGate` auto-redirect to checkout.
- **5.1.1(v) Account deletion** — built durable infra: migration `20260529_account_deletion_infrastructure` (`profiles.deleted_at` + `public.close_account()`), route anonymizes + 100-yr-bans the auth identity (NOT a hard delete — ~30 tables FK to auth.users; CASCADE would destroy payroll). UI: My Profile → Danger Zone → Delete My Account.

**Remaining (Apple-side, user must do):** ① confirm last build # in App Store Connect → TestFlight (use **4**); ② archive Build 4 + upload via Transporter (CLI in APP_STORE_RESUBMISSION.md §3); ③ paste App Review notes (§4) — the actual 2.1 blocker fix; ④ post-deploy e2e test of account deletion with a throwaway operator.

## ⚡ (Prior session notes) — iOS ITMS-90683 fix

### 1. 🍎 Apple Rejection Fix (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
Apple rejected Build 1.0.0 (3) due to **ITMS-90683** — missing `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` key. Apple's automated binary scanner requires BOTH location keys whenever any linked SDK (Capacitor Geolocation plugin) references location APIs, even when "always on" is never actually requested by the app.

**The fix is already applied** — `ios/App/App/Info.plist` has `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` added (it's a staged change, not yet committed). Verify with `git diff ios/App/App/Info.plist`.

**Steps to resolve:**
```bash
# Step 1 — Commit the Info.plist fix
cd "/Users/afa55/Documents/Pontifex Industres/pontifex-platform"
git add ios/App/App/Info.plist
git commit -m "fix(ios): add NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription for Apple ITMS-90683"

# Step 2 — Push all pending commits to prod (Google Maps fix + Info.plist fix)
# Ask user first: "Can I push to main? 2 commits, ~$1-2 cost"
git push origin main

# Step 3 — Rebuild the iOS archive with updated Info.plist
cd ios/App
xcodebuild archive \
  -project App.xcodeproj \
  -scheme App \
  -configuration Release \
  -destination "generic/platform=iOS" \
  -archivePath /tmp/PontifexArchive.xcarchive

xcodebuild -exportArchive \
  -archivePath /tmp/PontifexArchive.xcarchive \
  -exportOptionsPlist ExportOptions.plist \
  -exportPath /tmp/PontifexExport

# Step 4 — Upload new IPA via Transporter.app (free, Mac App Store)
# Drag ~/Desktop/PontifexExport/App.ipa into Transporter → Deliver
# NOTE: Increment Build number in Xcode General tab before archiving
#   Version: 1.0.0 → stays same
#   Build:   3 → 4  (must be higher than previously rejected build)

# Step 5 — In App Store Connect: go to the rejected submission,
# select the new build (4), and click "Submit for Review" again
```

**Check email first:** Apple sends a rejection email with specific reasons to pontifexindustries@gmail.com. Read it before rebuilding — there may be additional rejection reasons beyond ITMS-90683.

### 2. Push Pending Web Commits
Two commits are ready and need to be pushed to `main` together (ask user first):
- `f78a76af` — fix: silence Google Maps console errors when API key is not configured
- `ios/App/App/Info.plist` change (once committed per Step 1 above)

### 3. Set Google Maps API Key (Optional but Recommended)
Address autocomplete is currently degraded to plain text input everywhere. If you want it working:
- Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIza...` in Vercel → project → Settings → Environment Variables
- The code is already guarded to load Maps only when the key is present

## Ruflo — AI Orchestration Layer

**Ruflo is installed.** Evidence: `agentdb.rvf`, `agentdb.rvf.lock`, `.claude-flow/` directory, `ruvector.db` all present in the repo root.

Ruflo is a multi-agent AI orchestration layer that runs on top of Claude Code. It provides:
- **AgentDB** — HNSW vector memory that persists learned patterns across sessions
- **Swarm coordination** — hierarchical/mesh/ring topologies for parallel agents
- **Self-learning routing** — routes tasks to best agent based on prior success
- **30+ Claude Code skills** — pre-built workflows for common patterns

**Reference file:** `RUFLO_REFERENCE.md` — full install guide, commands, plugin list

**How we use Ruflo in this project:**
- The AgentDB (`.claude-flow/` + `agentdb.rvf`) stores our migration patterns, RLS conventions, API response format so agents know our stack without re-explaining every session
- Background workers may auto-analyze code quality between sessions
- Use `ruflo hive status` to check swarm health

**Key Ruflo commands:**
```bash
ruflo hive status                    # Check if swarm is healthy
ruflo sparc modes                    # List available SPARC modes
ruflo orchestrate "task desc" --parallel  # Run task with parallel agents
ruflo memory status                  # Check vector memory state
```

## iOS Apple Rejection — Full Technical Context

### What Happened
App Build 1.0.0 (3) was submitted May 25, 2026. Apple's automated binary analysis returned **ITMS-90683** (or similar location-related rejection). The issue: Apple's scanner detects that Capacitor's Geolocation plugin references the CoreLocation framework's "always" location APIs internally, so Apple requires BOTH `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` AND `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` to be present in `Info.plist`, even though the app never explicitly requests "always on" permission.

### The Fix (Already Applied)
`ios/App/App/Info.plist` now includes both keys:
```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Pontifex verifies you are at the job site when you clock in. Your location is checked once per clock-in event and is not tracked in the background.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Pontifex verifies you are at the job site when you clock in. Your location is only used during the clock-in check and is never tracked in the background.</string>
```

### Resubmission Checklist
```
[ ] git add ios/App/App/Info.plist && git commit -m "fix(ios): add NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription for ITMS-90683"
[ ] git push origin main (batch with f78a76af — ask user first, costs ~$1-2)
[ ] Open ios/App/App.xcodeproj in Xcode
[ ] Increment Build number: General tab → Build: 3 → 4
[ ] Product → Archive
[ ] Window → Organizer → Distribute App → App Store Connect → Upload
[ ] App Store Connect → select new build (4) → Submit for Review
```

**Check email first!** Apple may list more than one issue. Read the rejection email at pontifexindustries@gmail.com before resubmitting.

### Common Apple Rejection Reasons for Capacitor Apps (Watch For These)
1. **ITMS-90683** — missing privacy usage description key ← FIXED
2. **Guideline 4.0** — app is a web wrapper without native functionality (mitigation: show GPS clock-in, NFC, camera features prominently in screenshots/description)
3. **Guideline 2.1** — app crashes on launch (test with TestFlight on real device first)
4. **Missing screenshots** — must have minimum 3 screenshots at 1290×2796 (iPhone 6.7")
5. **Demo account required** — Apple reviewer needs login credentials. Include in App Review Information:
   - Company Code: PATRIOT
   - Email: admin@pontifex.com
   - Password: PontifexDemo2026!

## Architecture & Key Patterns

### Role Hierarchy (highest → lowest)
```
super_admin → operations_manager → admin → salesman → shop_manager → inventory_manager → operator → apprentice
```
Plus parallel roles: `supervisor` (field oversight), `shop_help` (shop assistant)

### Provider Stack (Root Layout)
```
ThemeProvider > BrandingProvider > NotificationProvider > ErrorBoundary > NetworkMonitor > GoogleMapsProvider > App
```
- `GoogleMapsProvider` — NOW guards against missing API key. Only calls `useJsApiLoader` when `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is set. When missing, renders children with `{ isLoaded: false }` (no errors, components degrade to plain text inputs).

### Auth Pattern
- **Server-side:** `requireAuth()`, `requireAdmin()`, `requireSuperAdmin()`, `requireScheduleBoardAccess()` from `lib/api-auth.ts`
- **Client-side:** `getCurrentUser()` from `lib/auth.ts` with role array check in `useEffect`
- **Supabase admin client** (`lib/supabase-admin.ts`): all server-side DB ops (bypasses RLS)
- **Supabase public client** (`lib/supabase.ts`): client-side only

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
- Every table has `tenant_id` (UUID, FK to `public.tenants`)
- Login uses company code → `lookup_tenant_by_code()` SECURITY DEFINER RPC (called from browser directly — no Lambda hop)
- White-label branding: `BrandingProvider` reads `tenants.logo_url`, `tenants.primary_color`, etc.
- Branding cached in localStorage (`'patriot-branding'` key, 5-minute TTL)

### RLS Pattern — CRITICAL RULES
```sql
-- ✅ CORRECT — reads from public.profiles via SECURITY DEFINER helper
USING (
  public.current_user_has_role('admin', 'super_admin', 'operations_manager')
  AND tenant_id = public.current_user_tenant_id()
)

-- ❌ NEVER DO THIS — user_metadata is client-writable via supabase.auth.updateUser()
-- Supabase linter flags this as rls_references_user_metadata (ERROR)
USING (
  auth.jwt() -> 'user_metadata' ->> 'role' = 'admin'
)
```

**SECURITY DEFINER helpers (always use these for RLS):**
- `public.is_admin()` — true for `admin` or `super_admin`
- `public.current_user_role()` — returns the caller's `profiles.role`
- `public.current_user_tenant_id()` — returns the caller's `profiles.tenant_id`
- `public.current_user_has_role(VARIADIC text[])` — membership check against a list

### API Response Format
```typescript
return NextResponse.json({ success: true, data: {...} })         // success
return NextResponse.json({ error: 'message' }, { status: 400 }) // error
```

### Audit Logging (fire-and-forget — never block main response)
```typescript
Promise.resolve(supabaseAdmin.from('audit_logs').insert({...})).then(() => {}).catch(() => {})
```

### Stripe Init Pattern (CRITICAL — never put at module level)
Stripe must be initialized inside route handlers, not at module top-level. Module-level code runs during `npm run build` when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is not present in the build environment.
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT — inside the handler
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!);
  ...
}

// ❌ WRONG — breaks Vercel build
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!);
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) { ... }
```

---

## Development Workflow

### Session Pattern
1. **Start every session:** Read `CLAUDE_HANDOFF.md` (this file) + run quick sanity checks
2. **Check pending work:** `git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline`
3. **Build check:** `npm run build` (must be 0 errors before doing anything)
4. **Work through the "Start Here" section** at the top of this file
5. **After each feature:** `npm run build`, commit with descriptive message
6. **End of session:** Update this file, confirm before pushing `main`

### Quick Sanity Checks (Run at Session Start)
```bash
# 1. Confirm branch + pending commits
git log --oneline -5
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline
git status --short

# 2. Verify build passes (must be 0 errors)
npm run build

# 3. Start dev server if doing UI work
npm run dev   # port 3000
```

### Git / Cost Discipline
```bash
# NEVER push without asking: "Can I push? ~$1-2 cost"
# Each push to main = Vercel build = $1-2
git push origin main   # only after user confirms

# Safe — never triggers a build
git commit -m "..."
```

### Parallel Agent Pattern (How to Build Fast)
Claude spawns multiple specialized agents simultaneously. Standard pattern:
1. `supabase-migration-author` → migration SQL (idempotent DDL + SECURITY DEFINER + RLS)
2. `rls-policy-auditor` → validates policies in parallel
3. `backend-dev` → API routes under `app/api/`
4. `coder` → UI pages/components (concurrently with API)
5. `mobile-responsive-auditor` → sweeps operator pages at 375px/414px before push

Use `Agent({ isolation: "worktree" })` for large multi-file features to prevent conflicts. **CRITICAL:** Worktrees do NOT inherit `.env.local` — copy it before making Supabase calls.

### iOS Build Commands
```bash
# Archive for App Store
cd ios/App
xcodebuild archive \
  -project App.xcodeproj \
  -scheme App \
  -configuration Release \
  -destination "generic/platform=iOS" \
  -archivePath /tmp/PontifexArchive.xcarchive

# Export IPA
xcodebuild -exportArchive \
  -archivePath /tmp/PontifexArchive.xcarchive \
  -exportOptionsPlist ExportOptions.plist \
  -exportPath /tmp/PontifexExport

# Upload via Transporter.app (Mac App Store — free)
# Drag /tmp/PontifexExport/App.ipa → Deliver

# NOTE: Build number MUST increment each submission
# Version stays 1.0.0, Build: 3 → 4 → 5 etc.
```

## Security Audit Summary (May 25–26, 2026)

| Finding | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 10 job-orders routes: `if (tenantId)` silently skipped tenant filter | CRIT-1 | ✅ FIXED |
| `user_metadata` RLS references (audit agent false positive — not in prod) | CRIT-2 | ✅ FALSE POSITIVE |
| `clock-out/route.ts` missing `requireAuth()` | MED-2 | ✅ FIXED |
| Customer portal `.or()` string interpolation (SQL injection vector) | HIGH-3 | ✅ FIXED |
| In-memory rate limiter doesn't survive cold starts | HIGH-2 | ⏳ OPEN — fix: enable Supabase Auth rate limits in dashboard (5 min user action) |
| CSP `unsafe-inline` | MED-5 | ⏳ OPEN — nonce-based CSP (next sprint) |
| `signOut({ scope: 'global' })` instead of local | LOW | ⏳ OPEN |

## Stripe Billing (FULLY LIVE)

**Stripe account:** acct_1THphn0WWq11qMKi (live mode)

| Object | ID/Value |
|---|---|
| Product | prod_UagOHFDdm4Tw2N — "Pontifex Industries Platform" |
| 6-Month price | price_1TbV2E0WWq11qMKimnEXVElP — $3,747 / 6 months |
| Annual price | price_1TbV2E0WWq11qMKidsCGCrl8 — $6,997 / year |
| Webhook | we_1TbrUh0WWq11qMKi43RmaRgC → /api/stripe/webhook |
| Events | checkout.session.completed, subscription.updated/deleted, invoice.payment_failed |

Patriot is on `subscription_status = 'trialing'` — paywall gate allows full access. Tell Claude when trial ends → flip to `'active'`.

## Complete Feature Inventory

### 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture
- Company code login → `lookup_tenant_by_code()` SECURITY DEFINER RPC (browser calls Supabase directly — no Lambda)
- White-label branding per tenant (`BrandingProvider`, logo, colors)
- Every table has `tenant_id` + RLS via SECURITY DEFINER helpers

### 2. RBAC (10 roles)
- `ADMIN_CARDS` array in `lib/rbac.ts` drives dashboard card visibility
- `ROLE_PERMISSION_PRESETS` for sidebar filtering

### 3. Schedule Board (`app/dashboard/admin/schedule-board/` — ~2850 lines)
- Operator rows with time-off blocking, skill warnings, real-time status colors
- Inline editing: scope, operators, notes, Mark Out (rose) to block operator
- Dispatch modal with PDF ticket generation
- Smart scheduling: per-scope skill matching (good / stretch / under-skilled / busy panels)

### 4. Schedule Form (Multi-step job creation)
- Steps: Customer → Project → Scope → Equipment → Difficulty → Scheduling → Site Compliance
- Linear Ft + Cut Depth calculator (auto LF from dimensions + cross-cut spacing + overcut)
- Edit mode via `?editJobId=<uuid>&jumpTo=scope`

---

## What's Next (Prioritized Backlog)

### 🔴 Immediate (This Session)
1. **Commit + push iOS Info.plist fix** → rebuild iOS archive → resubmit to App Store (see top of file)
2. **Push `f78a76af`** (Google Maps fix) — batch with iOS commit

### 🟡 Short-Term (User Actions Required)
3. **Supabase Auth rate limits** (HIGH-2) — Dashboard → Auth → Settings → enable rate limits (5 min, user does this)
4. **Twilio toll-free verification** — twilio.com → opt-in URL: `https://www.pontifexindustries.com/sms-opt-in`
5. **Rotate Twilio Auth Token** — was briefly visible in a screenshot (hygiene)
6. **Upload Patriot logo** → Settings → Company Branding → Icon (Square) → Save
7. **Verify email env vars** in Vercel: `RESEND_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
8. **Add Google Maps API key** in Vercel → restores address autocomplete

### 🟢 Code Backlog
9. **APNs push logic** — vars are set in Vercel; implement server-side send in `/api/push/route.ts` (client already calls `/api/push/register` on APNs token registration — server side just needs to store token + send via `lib/send-push.ts`)
10. **Android app** — after iOS approval: `npx cap add android` + $25 Google Play fee
11. **Schedule board refactor** — `schedule-board/page.tsx` is ~2850 lines; extract `OperatorRow`, `JobCard`, `EditModal`, `DispatchModal` to `_components/`
12. **CSP nonce-based** (MED-5) — replace `unsafe-inline` with nonce injection
13. **Apply pending migrations:** `20260427_utility_waiver_fields.sql`, `20260427_operator_badges.sql`
